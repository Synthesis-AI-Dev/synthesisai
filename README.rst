Library for loading Synthesis AI Datasets


* Free software: MIT license
* Documentation: https://synthesis-ai-dev.github.io/synthesisai

See a `quickstart <examples/quickstart.ipynb%3E>`__ for jupyter notebook
with tutorial. |Open In Colab|

Also visit a more detailed example with
`landmarks <examples/landmarks.ipynb>`__. |Open In Colab1|

To familiarize with different coordinate systems used in the dataset,
see `transforms <examples/transforms.ipynb>`__. |Open In Colab2|

To see, how to use camera intrinsics to transition between 3D and 2D
coordinates and to reconstruct head from the depth data, see
`intrinsics <examples/intrinsics.ipynb>`__. |Open In Colab3|

To learn more how to group images from the same camera scene, see
`grouping <examples/grouping.ipynb>`__. |Open In Colab4|

To learn more about multi-human scenarios, see
`multi-human <examples/multi_human.ipynb>`__. |Open In Colab5|
